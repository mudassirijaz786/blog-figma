with hardware capable of mining have invested a lot of time, money,
and love into our rigs, and wouldn’t dare risk our PC’s health for
anything, even extra income. Our mission at Salad is to demystify and
simplify mining for would-be adopters. We see crypto as critical to
web 3.0, and we think we can help jump start the generation of users
who make a decentralized internet possible.`;

profitability (or the lack thereof), we wanted to clear the waters and
make a definitive guide to the impact mining has on your PC, from
electricity costs to wear and tear. That way on-the-fence miners can
make an informed decision about whether to jump in the blockchain
headfirst or stick to the sidelines.`;
